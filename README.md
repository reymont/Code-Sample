Community Detection Algorithm using Label Propagation (Multithreading with Java)

I have implemented the algorithm mentioned in the paper "Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks", by Usha Nandini Raghavan, Reka Albert, Soundar Kumara.
I have also added the modification suggested by Kishore Kothapalli, Sriram V. Pemmaraju, and Vivek Sardeshmukh, in the paper "On the Analysis of a Label Propagation Algorithm for Community Detection"; which prevents epidemic spread of communities.
